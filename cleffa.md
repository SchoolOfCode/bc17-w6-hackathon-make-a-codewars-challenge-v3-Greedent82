This task is the easy mode version. The last thing I want to do is stress anyone out :)

That said, if that sounds like a good time, try out `clefairy,md` , `clefairy.js`, and `clefairy.test.js`

# How many words can you make out of CLEFFA? 

Let's find out!

Hey guys! Frank here :D, my challenge to you is the following...

Create a function that takes in a word. You should then check the word to see if it only uses the letters present in CLEFFA,
so C, L, E, F, and A. You can reuse letters. If it does, you should return `'Good job!'`. If it contains letters not present in cleffa, you should return `'Nope'`. 

Further to this, the function should work even in cases of odd capitalisation

# For example
`'cacophony'` contains O , P , H , N , and Y, which are not present in CLEFFA. It should return `'Nope'`
`'FellA'` only uses letters present in  CLEFFA, so should return `'Good job!'`

Best of luck, I hope it's at least a little fun :)
