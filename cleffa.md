This task is the easy mode version. The last thing I want to do is stress anyone out :)

That said, if that sounds like a good time, try out `clefairy,md` , `clefairy.js`, and `clefairy.test.js`

# How many words can you make out of CLEFFA? 

Let's find out!

Hey guys! Frank here :D, my challenge to you is the following...

Create a function that takes in a word. You should then check the word to see if it only uses the letters present in CLEFFA,
so C, L, E, F, and A. You can reuse letters. If it does, you should return `'Good job!'`. If it contains letters not present in cleffa, you should return `'Nope'`. 

Further to this, the function should work even in cases of odd capitalisation

# For example
`'cacophony'` contains O , P , H , N , and Y, which are not present in CLEFFA. It should return `'Nope'`
`'FellA'` only uses letters present in  CLEFFA, so should return `'Good job!'`

If you're still stuck, I'd suggest casting your mind back to how you created the scrabble function, it's similar to that! 

Also note that you need to test with npm run test cleffa.test.js so you dont test the hard mode functions

Best of luck, I hope it's at least a little fun :)

# Plan 

If you're still stuck I included a plan to nudge you along :D. Feel free to collapse this by pressing the arrow between line 25 and `#Plan` if you'd rather do this no spoilers

1. Set up an array with the letters in cleffa
2. google how the 'split' function works and split 'word'
3. make a for of loop that check each letter of the word inputted
4. If a letter is found not to be present in your cleffa array, it should return nope
5. If it gets to the end of the split word array and didnt find any unincluded letters, it should return Good job!

Speaking of, good job to you too, I hope it wasn't too taxing! :D
